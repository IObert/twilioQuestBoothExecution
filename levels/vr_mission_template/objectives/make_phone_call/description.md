# Call: Call me when you want!

Using your own tools or the **code editor**, make a Phone Call using the Twilio API. When a new Call is created via the API, it is assigned a unique identifier - a **SID**. This SID will be [included in the data sent back from a successful API request](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/call-resource#call-properties).

Retrieve a call SID after a successful API request and enter it into the text field on the right. When you hit *HACK*, we'll validate that this message SID exists in your Twilio account, and you will be victorious!
