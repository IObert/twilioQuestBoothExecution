To complete this challenge, you will need to <strong>obtain a programmable, Twilio-powered phone number.</strong> Phone numbers can be found and purchased in <a href="https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming" >your Twilio console</a>.

Once you have secured a phone number, enter it in <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164" >E.164 format </a> on the right. The validator will be very picky about this format, so use it exactly! For example, the German phone number "01573 5987400" would need to be entered as `+49 1573 5987400`.
