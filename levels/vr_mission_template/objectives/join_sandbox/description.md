# Start a WhatsApp messaging session

WhatsApp messages are subject to specific rules and restrictions that do not apply to standard Twilio Programmable SMS and MMS messages. Understanding the concept of “sessions” is essential to designing your messaging flows.

A messaging **session** starts when a user sends your application a message and lasts 24 hours from the most recently received message. A session includes all incoming messages or outgoing replies to these messages within 24 hours. Session messages do not need to follow a template and can include media attachments.
