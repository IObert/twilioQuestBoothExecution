# SMS: Send Me Something!

Using your own tools or the **code editor**, send a WhatsApp message using the Twilio API. When a new Message is created via the API, it is assigned a unique identifier - a **SID**. This SID will be [included in the data sent back from a successful API request](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-resource#message-properties).

Retrieve a message SID after a successful API request and enter it into the text field on the right. When you hit *HACK*, we'll validate that this message SID exists in your Twilio account, and you will be victorious!
