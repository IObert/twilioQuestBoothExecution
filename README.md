## Getting Started
The first step is to enable extensions in the TQ game client.

**NOTE:** TwilioQuest Extensions are only available in the **3.2** version of the game. As of spring 2021, the current stable version of the game is 3.1.x. You may need to use the launcher to select the "3.2 Preview" release channel to use a version of the game that supports extensions.

### Enabling extensions

In the `Settings` UI (press the `3` key in-game), navigate to the `Extensions` submenu. Click the button there labeled `Enable Extensions`.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** As indicated in the UI, make sure to only use extensions from trusted sources. Like "mods" from other games you may have played before (Minecraft, Skyrim, etc.), a TwilioQuest extension will be able to execute code on your computer. Exercise caution when installing an extension, just as you would using any third-party code on your computer.

Once you have enabled extensions, specify a folder on your computer where you will download and manage extensions. This should be the [full path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_name#Filenames_and_paths) to an empty folder on your computer (you should create such a folder first, if you haven't already).

Once you have enabled extensions, you should see a listing of automatically-installed "base extensions", and a list of any extensions you have installed yourself.
